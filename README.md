## Three orbiting masses
Three particles with different mass orbiting (similar to moon-earth-sun system). The smaller particle has a mass of 10^3, the medium particle 10^5 and the central particle 10^8. Eventually the smaller mass gets too close to the larger one and is blown away.

## Collapsing rotating disc
Simulation of 2 * 10^4 particles, all with the same mass. Initially they are placed uniformly at random on the area of a circle with radius 5 and angular velocity of 0.015Ï€ rad/s. The angular velocity is low enough so that the disk collapses on itself.
